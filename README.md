This is the Data Engineer Exercise task for MissionWired.
The .csv files used in the file can be found here: 
* Constituent Information: https://als-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/fake_data/2020-07-01_17%3A11%3A00/cons.csv
* Constituent Email Addresses: https://als-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/fake_data/2020-07-01_17%3A11%3A00/cons_email.csv
* Constituent Subscription Status: https://als-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/fake_data/2020-07-01_17%3A11%3A00/cons_email_chapter_subscription.csv

Download these .csv files to your working directory (they are too large to upload here to github even in a .zip file). 
This code modifies those files, creates two new .csv files called "people" and "acquisition_facts", and saves them back to your working directory. 

I created this code in an .ipynb file (Jupyter notebook), but have provided the plain .py file as well.
